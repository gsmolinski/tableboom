The goal of `{tableboom}` is to let user choose the R script to inspect
intermediate results of all calls (using
[`{boomer}`](https://github.com/moodymudskipper/boomer)) in the form of
HTML table. Three main features are:

-   give the user possibility to inspect intermediate steps of all calls
    in the chosen R script, i.e.Â no need to `boomer::boom()` each call
    separately;
-   prepare output as an HTML document, so it can be read *outside* of
    programming process;
-   prepare HTML document as a table, *but* trying to make it more like
    a *word story* than table;

With this software, vignette `Treating Code As Data - Notes` was
prepared as some kind of tutorial about metaprogramming (in the part it
is used in `{tableboom}`), which is available also online: [Treating
Code As Data - Notes](http://rpubs.com/grzegorzsmolinski/956611).

This package is intended to be a submission for **RStudio Table Contest
2022**.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{tableboom}` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gsmolinski/tableboom")

# or with vignette, but installation time will be much longer
devtools::install_github("gsmolinski/tableboom", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

Having the following example script which we would like to inspect:

    library(dplyr)

    path <- file.path(system.file(package = "tableboom","table_contest_2022", "inner_script"),
                      "eurostat_data.R")
    # Unfortunately, comments in separate lines are not included
    source(path) # data - children (< 18) from Ukraine which found temp protection

    names(child_ukr_prot) <- c("country", "march_2022", "april_2022",
                               "may_2022","june_2022", "july_2022", "august_2022")

    child_ukr_prot[5, "country"] <- stringi::stri_replace_all_regex(child_ukr_prot[5, "country"],
                                                                    "\\s+.+", "")

    child_ukr_prot <- child_ukr_prot |>
      mutate(across(matches("\\d$"), \(e) if_else(e == ":", NA_character_, e)),
             across(matches("\\d$"), as.integer))

    maxs <- vector("integer", ncol(child_ukr_prot) - 1)

    for (i in 2:(ncol(child_ukr_prot))) {
      maxs[[i - 1]] <- max(child_ukr_prot[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)
    }

    maxs

    total_months <- colSums(child_ukr_prot[, 2:ncol(child_ukr_prot)], na.rm = TRUE)

    format(sum(total_months), big.mark = " ")

    path()

the usage of `{tableboom}` is nothing more than calling `inspect_r()`
with the path to the script (or `NULL` argument - and then saved and
opened script in the RStudio editor will be used):

``` r
path <- file.path(system.file(package = "tableboom", "table_contest_2022"), "children_from_ukr_temp_prot_eu.R")

tableboom::inspect_r(path)
```
