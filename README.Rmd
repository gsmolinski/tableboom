[This package received Honorable Mention in Posit Table Contest 2022.](https://posit.co/blog/winners-of-the-2022-table-contest/)

The goal of `{tableboom}` is to let user choose the R script to inspect intermediate results of all calls (using [`{boomer}`](https://github.com/moodymudskipper/boomer)) in the form of HTML table. Three main features are:

- give the user possibility to inspect intermediate steps of all calls in the chosen R script, i.e. no need to `boomer::boom()` each call separately;
- prepare output as an HTML document, so it can be read *outside* of programming process;
- prepare HTML document as a table, *but* trying to make it more like a *word story* than table;

With this software, vignette `Treating Code As Data - Notes` was prepared as some kind of tutorial about metaprogramming (in the part it is used in `{tableboom}`), which is available also online: [Treating Code As Data - Notes](http://rpubs.com/grzegorzsmolinski/956611).

This package is intended to be a submission for **RStudio Table Contest 2022**.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{tableboom}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gsmolinski/tableboom")

# or with vignette, but installation time will be much longer
devtools::install_github("gsmolinski/tableboom", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

Having the following example script which we would like to inspect:

```{r script_to_inspect, echo = FALSE}
cat(paste0(readLines(file.path(system.file(package = "tableboom", "table_contest_2022"), "children_from_ukr_temp_prot_eu.R")), collapse = "\n"))
```

the usage of `{tableboom}` is nothing more than calling `inspect_r()` with the path to the script (or `NULL` argument - and then saved and opened script in the RStudio editor will be used):

```{r inspect_r, eval = FALSE}
path <- file.path(system.file(package = "tableboom", "table_contest_2022"), "children_from_ukr_temp_prot_eu.R")

tableboom::inspect_r(path)
```
