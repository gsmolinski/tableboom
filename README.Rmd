The aim of `{tableboom}` is to let user choose the R script to inspect intermediate results of all calls in the form of HTML table. Three main aims are:

- give the user possibility to inspect intermediate steps of all calls in the chosen R script, i.e. no need to `boomer::boom()` each call separately;
- prepare output as an HTML document, so it can be read *outside* of programming process;
- prepare HTML document as a table, *but* trying to make it more like a *word story* than table;

I have imagine situation when we have made an R script, run it, but the result is not satisfactory. However, rather than interactively trying to solve the problem, we would like just to *read* it as a book and think about this outside of the IDE.

This package is intended to be a submission for **RStudio Table Contest 2022**.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{tableboom}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gsmolinski/tableboom")
```

## Example

Having the script as below which we would like to inspect:

```{r script_to_inspect, echo = FALSE}
cat(paste0(readLines(file.path(system.file(package = "tableboom", "table_contest_2022"), "children_from_ukr_temp_prot_eu.R")), collapse = "\n"))
```

The usage of `{tableboom}` is nothing more than calling `inspect_r()` with the path to the script (or `NULL` argument and then saved and opened script in the RStudio editor will be used):

```{r inspect_r, eval = FALSE}
path <- file.path(system.file(package = "tableboom", "table_contest_2022"), "children_from_ukr_temp_prot_eu.R")

tableboom::inspect_r(path)
```
