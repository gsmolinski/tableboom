- No need to exclude defined functions, easier will be to exclude later, after calling `boom` on these functions - we can just check if the first line starts with '< function' and if yes, then do nothing
- For var calls, we need to call dplyr::glimpse as the output from `boom` looks bad even if print is `dplyr::glimpse`.
- It should be enough to check if expr is just a var call, in other cases print = dplyr::glimpse and excluding empty line should be enough
- We need to always check if the output from `boom` contains empty line - most probaly this is an indicator that below empty line is output we don't want to include, like here: `boomer::boom(dplyr::select(iris, 1), print = dplyr::glimpse)`
- remember to set `options(boomer.safe.printing = TRUE)` and `options(boomer.visible_only = TRUE)`, this last case for `source()` calls. And inform user about this!
- do not perform anything if getParseData() returns nrow() == 0 and display error.
